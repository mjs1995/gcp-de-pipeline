# Kubernetes Data Pipeline Architecture
  - We've built an efficient pipeline for data processing on Kubernetes, integrating open-source technologies optimized for large-scale data handling.
  - **Object Storage (MinIO)**: An S3-compatible solution for scalable and reliable data lakes.
  - **Data Orchestration (Apache Airflow)**: Manages complex data tasks with stability and control.
  - **SQL Query Engine (Trino)**: Executes fast analytic queries directly on data stored in MinIO without the need for data movement.
  - **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)**: Real-time performance monitoring and visualization of the data pipeline.
